## Description
- Give people alternatives to calling 911 when they, or someone around them are in particular types of crisis 
- Work towards decoupling access to health care from policing
- This information would be provided via crowdsourcing resources for trained responders(not police) from communities directly
## User Story
- This would be a mobile app that would have two parts:
- First is a forum that would allow users to share resources. Other users can comment as well as and up vote, or down vote, different suggestions for resources.
- Second is a section that users can easily access when in crisis, with the click of a button. When needed, the top 3-5 up-voted resources are rendered, along with phone numbers for easy access in an emergency.
- Our application would use location services to connect users to the forums, and reasources for their regional area

## Context
#### I believe this goal has many specs that need to be flushed out before it is in a state to be to work on.

There is a lot of work needed to more clearly define user stories and understand the technical stack needed to build this application. I propose that those of us who are interested on working on this goal and getting it out of draft set a time to meet to work on:
- [ ] Reaching out to already existing groups that are organizing on this issue to partner with:  http://criticalresistance.org/chapters/cr-oakland/the-oakland-power-projects/
  https://occupypublichealth.wordpress.com/about/sfbayarea/ 
  https://www.1degree.org/

*\* Please offer up suggestions of other organizations that may be good to reach out to...
- [ ] Clearly define technical stack that is needed to build this app: React native, some SQL DB, ORM Library, etc.
- [ ] Level up our technical and programming skills in areas we have not worked in yet.
## Specifications

**\* Lets work together to define specs!
### Required

I would like the project to be open source. We would have to work to set up the project completely and define contribution guidelines and structure before goal is moved out of draft.
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
## Quality Rubric

**\* Lets work together to define quality rubric in order to move this goal out of draft.
### Please comment with feedback on this goal. If people are serious about building this application lets put in the time outside of LG hours to move this goal out of draft!
