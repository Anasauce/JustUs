## Description
- Give people alternatives to calling 911 when they, or someone around them are in particular types of crisis
- Work towards decoupling access to health care from policing
- This information would be provided via crowdsourcing resources for trained responders(not police) from communities directly
## User Story
- This would be a mobile app that would have two parts:
- First is a forum that would allow users to share resources. Other users can comment as well as and up vote, or down vote, different suggestions for resources.
- Second is a section that users can easily access when in crisis, with the click of a button. When needed, the top 3-5 up-voted resources are rendered, along with phone numbers for easy access in an emergency.
- Our application would use location services to connect users to the forums, and reasources for their regional area
